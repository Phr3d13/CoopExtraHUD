CoopExtraHUD enhances the co-op experience in The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ by displaying each player's passive collectible items in a clean, minimal grid HUD on the side of the screen. Inspired by the base game's aesthetic, the layout scales dynamically and includes optional dividing lines between player sections.

Still a WIP!

Key Features:
- Displays passive items for each co-op player.
- Auto-adjusting layout with optional scale and opacity control.
- Configurable spacing, offsets, and divider position.
- Supports Mod Config Menu for easy in-game customization.
- Smart positioning to avoid overlapping with the map or HUD (MinimapAPI support included).
- Debug overlay for development and positioning tweaks.

Perfect for streamers, couch co-op players, or anyone who wants better clarity in chaotic runs.
