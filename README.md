**CoopExtraHUD** enhances the co-op experience in *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+* by showing each player’s passive collectibles in a clean, minimal grid HUD on the right side of your screen.

Choose between two HUD styles:

- **Updated Preset:** Centered vertically along the right edge for balanced, easy viewing.  
- **Vanilla+ Preset:** Right-justified just below the map area, keeping that classic feel.

The HUD dynamically scales with the number of players and items, plus you can customize nearly everything — scale, opacity, spacing, offsets, and divider lines — all in-game via the Mod Config Menu.
